## Welcome 
Welcome to the code and slide repository for the [Asynchronous Programming With Python Course](https://pythoncomputing.com/#section-training). 

All examples here are meant to be self-contained and should work on any platform where Python runs. The examples are written for Python 3.6 or later but should run under older versions of Python (including Python 2.x) with only minor modifications. The notable exceptions are the examples based on asyncio: for those one needs Python 3.4 or later.

A note on code quality: this is demo-quality code, most definitely not production-quality. It is meant to illustrate a point and be an aide to the course.
