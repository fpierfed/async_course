# [Asynchronous Programming With Python](https://pythoncomputing.com/training/async) - Syllabus
#### _Francesco Pierfederici_


## Home Page
 * Course: https://pythoncomputing.com/training/async
 * Code: https://github.com/fpierfed/async_course


## Course Objectives
 * The main goal of this course is to gain a deep understanding of asynchronous programming with Python and asyncio.
 * The secondary goal is for the student to feel at home when using any other asynchronous framework in Python, not just asyncio.


## Course Organisation
Seventeen (not counting the course introduction) video lessons, approximately one hour in length each.


## Course Format
Lecture (with slides) for the first couple of lessons. "Live" coding for the rest.


## Requirements
 * Basic knowledge of the Python programming language is assumed. 
 * No knowledge of asynchronous programming is expected. 
 * While the course is taught using Python 3.6.3 or later, most of the material works (with trivial modifications) on older versions of Python, including Python 2.x.
